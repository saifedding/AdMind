🎉 Backend API & Background Task Worker Setup - COMPLETE!
I have successfully implemented the dual-process backend architecture as requested. Here's what was accomplished:
✅ Completed Implementation:
1. Configuration Management
✅ Created backend/app/core/config.py - Centralized configuration management using environment variables
✅ Environment Variable Support: All settings automatically read from environment variables with sensible defaults
2. FastAPI Application
✅ Updated backend/app/main.py - Enhanced FastAPI app with configuration integration
✅ Health Endpoint: Returns {"status": "ok"} exactly as requested
✅ Detailed Health Check: Monitors database, Redis, and Celery worker connectivity
✅ CORS Configuration: Properly configured using settings
3. Celery Worker Configuration
✅ Created backend/app/celery_worker.py - Separate Celery instance with Redis broker integration
✅ Redis Integration: Connected to Redis container for task brokerage and result storage
✅ Task Discovery: Automatically discovers tasks from app.tasks modules
4. Task System
✅ Created backend/app/tasks/ directory - Organized task structure
✅ add_together(x, y) Task: Implemented the exact test task requested in the prompt
✅ Additional Test Tasks: test_task() and long_running_task() for comprehensive testing
✅ Task API Endpoints: REST endpoints to dispatch and monitor tasks
5. Docker Integration
✅ Updated docker-compose.yml - Modified to use the new celery_worker.py configuration
✅ Separate Worker Process: Celery worker runs in its own container
✅ Separate Beat Process: Celery beat scheduler for periodic tasks
🔧 Architecture Overview:
Apply to main.py
📋 API Endpoints Available:
GET /api/v1/health - Returns {"status": "ok"}
GET /api/v1/health/detailed - Comprehensive system health check
POST /api/v1/test/add - Dispatch add_together task
GET /api/v1/test/task/{task_id} - Check task status
POST /api/v1/test/task - Dispatch general test task
🧪 Verification Results:
✅ Health Endpoint: Returns {"status": "ok"} ✓
✅ Celery Worker: Connected to Redis and ready ✓
✅ Task Integration: add_together(10, 15) = 25 completed successfully ✓
✅ Database: PostgreSQL connection working ✓
✅ Redis: Message broker operational ✓
🎯 Key Features Implemented:
🔄 Non-blocking Architecture: API requests don't block on long-running tasks
📡 Real-time Task Monitoring: Track task progress and results
🛡️ Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
📊 Health Monitoring: System status and component health checks
🔧 Configuration Management: Environment-based configuration
📦 Docker Integration: Fully containerized with proper service separation
Your backend now has a robust, scalable architecture that can handle both synchronous API requests and asynchronous background tasks efficiently! The system is ready for scraping, AI analysis, and other intensive operations without blocking the user experience. 🚀









✅ Core Components Implemented
Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
AdCreateDTO: Comprehensive Pydantic model for ad ingestion with validation
CompetitorCreateDTO: Model for competitor data
AdIngestionResponse: Response model for ingestion operations
Data Ingestion Service
DataIngestionService: Centralized business logic for ad ingestion
Handles competitor creation/updates
Manages ad creation/deduplication
Automatically triggers AI analysis tasks
Comprehensive error handling and logging
AI Analysis Integration
ai_analysis_task: Placeholder Celery task for AI analysis
batch_ai_analysis_task: Batch processing capability
Automatic task dispatch after successful ingestion
Internal API Router
POST /api/v1/internal/ingest: Single ad ingestion endpoint
POST /api/v1/internal/ingest/batch: Batch ingestion (up to 100 ads)
GET /api/v1/internal/stats: Ingestion statistics
GET /api/v1/internal/health: Internal health check
GET /api/v1/internal/api-key/test: API key validation
Security Implementation
API key authentication (Bearer token or X-API-Key header)
Protected internal endpoints
Input validation and sanitization
🔧 Key Features
Decoupled Architecture: External scrapers only need to POST data to the API
Automatic AI Analysis: Every ingested ad triggers analysis automatically
Batch Processing: Efficient handling of multiple ads
Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging
Duplicate Prevention: Automatic deduplication based on ad_archive_id
Competitor Management: Automatic competitor creation and updates
Statistics Tracking: Built-in metrics for monitoring ingestion
📊 Test Results
All comprehensive tests passed successfully:
✅ API key authentication working
✅ Single ad ingestion operational
✅ Batch ad ingestion functional
✅ AI analysis pipeline triggered correctly
✅ Statistics and health checks working
🚀 Usage Example
External Scraper Integration:
Apply to example_scra...
Curl Example:
Apply to example_scra...
Run
🔒 Security Configuration
API Key: your-super-secret-key-change-this-in-production-internal
Endpoints: All internal endpoints require authentication
Rate Limiting: Batch endpoint limited to 100 ads per request
📈 System Integration
The ingestion service is now fully integrated with:
PostgreSQL: Database storage for ads and competitors
Celery: Automatic AI analysis task dispatch
Redis: Task queue management
FastAPI: RESTful API endpoints
Logging: Comprehensive logging throughout the pipeline
🎯 Achievement Summary
✅ Single Entry Point: All scraped data flows through one service
✅ Automatic Processing: AI analysis triggered on every ingestion
✅ Scalable Architecture: Handles both single and batch operations
✅ Error Resilience: Comprehensive error handling and recovery
✅ Monitoring: Built-in statistics and health checks
✅ Security: API key authentication and input validation
✅ Documentation: Clear examples and integration patterns
Your external scraping scripts can now focus solely on data collection, while the ingestion service handles all database logic, AI analysis triggering, and error management!
