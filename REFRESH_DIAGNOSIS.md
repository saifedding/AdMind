# Media Refresh Service - Diagnosis & Resolution

## 🔍 **Problem Identified**

Ad `1575410853842599` (database ID: 34701) **cannot be refreshed** because it **no longer exists in Facebook's Ad Library**.

## 📊 **Diagnostic Evidence**

From the detailed logs, we can see:

### What's Working ✅
1. **All 3 fetch methods are executing correctly:**
   - Method 1: Deeplink search
   - Method 2: Keyword search with ALL status
   - Method 3: Page search (page_id: 129923153845537)

2. **Facebook IS responding:**
   - Returns 200 OK status
   - Returns valid JSON data with multiple edges
   - Contains ads from the same page

3. **Service is parsing correctly:**
   - Found edges in search results
   - Extracted collated_results
   - Compared ad IDs properly

### What's NOT Working ❌

The target ad ID `1575410853842599` is **not in Facebook's response**.

**Facebook returned these ads instead:**
- 1316980073470027
- 1438137304117986
- 1274671303937048
- 802885705730537
- 789882983526678
- 1281327707003697
- 1359120548879482
- 1088228213475392
- 1314002020400528
- 2623844741348600
- 3033210050192448

But **NOT** `1575410853842599`

## 💡 **Root Cause**

The ad has been **removed from Facebook's Ad Library**. This happens when:
- ❌ Advertiser deleted the ad
- ❌ Ad campaign ended and was archived
- ❌ Ad was too old and purged by Facebook
- ❌ Ad violated policies and was removed

**Note:** Ad 34701 was created on `2025-10-02 07:29:07` - about 8 hours before the most recent ads in the database.

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### 1. **Multi-Method Fallback System**
The service now tries 3 different methods to find ads:
- Direct deeplink lookup (fastest)
- Keyword search across ALL ads (active + inactive)
- Page-specific search (if page_id available)

### 2. **Improved Error Messages**

**Backend:**
```python
'error': f'Ad {ad_archive_id} not found in Facebook Ad Library. The ad may have been deleted or is no longer available.'
```

**Frontend:**
Now extracts and displays the actual error message from the backend instead of generic "Failed to refresh media".

### 3. **Comprehensive Logging**
Added INFO-level logs showing:
- Response sizes from Facebook
- Number of edges/results returned
- Ad IDs being compared
- Where exactly the search fails

## 🧪 **Testing Recommendations**

### Test with a Recent Ad
Try refreshing one of these recent ads to verify the service works:
- Ad ID: 34767 (archive_id: 1158259596161078) - created Oct 2, 2025 15:05
- Ad ID: 34766 (archive_id: 780250574874456)
- Ad ID: 34765 (archive_id: 1521663832590531)

### Expected Behavior

**For deleted/unavailable ads:**
```
✗ Ad 1575410853842599 not found in Facebook Ad Library. 
  The ad may have been deleted or is no longer available.
```

**For available ads:**
```
✓ Media refreshed successfully!
```
